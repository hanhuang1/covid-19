# Utilization of python to prep and integrate data on the spread of covid-19

Code creator: Han Huang <br />
<br />
An example of use of the prepped data in Tableau can be seen on my Tableau public page: https://public.tableau.com/profile/hanhuang#!/vizhome/NewJerseyandCovid19UpdateBrief/NJDashboard-Fixed <br />
<br />
This repo is still work in progress. I am planning to add additional visualizations at the state level and add county level data on my Tableau Public profile. As updates are made this repo will be updated accordingluy. <br />
<br />
The innitial focus of the visualizations on my Tableau Public profile is initially on New Jersey (the State where I live). Some of the data manipulations in this repo have been added to make creating vizualizations and pulling of specific data points more efficient in Tableau using Tableau's calculated field functionality and the pulling of individual data points into chart titles for inclusion in Tableau relating to New Jersey. These data columns should be ignored when looking at states other than NJ. <br />
<br />
Tableau Public does not allow automated data refresh.
